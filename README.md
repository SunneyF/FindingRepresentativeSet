# Finding Representative Set

The repository has two folders including data for the Generalized tactical resource allocation problem (GTRAP) and three-dimensional knapsack problem (the source of this is https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/homepage/ist175325/instances).

GTRAP: The GTRAP is a model developed for GKN Aerospace AB,Sweden. The instances are made publicly accessible and the names of parts are sanitized. The model is capacitated multi-level resource allocation problem (<\cite>). The input parameters required are processing times, qualification costs, upper bounds on inventory, demand. The data shared here consists of <em> Constant data </em>, that is same across all the 15 instances. Instance specific data is stored in <a href="https://github.com/SunneyF/FindingRepresentativeSet/blob/main/GTRAP/GTRAP_instances.zip">GTRAP instances</a>
